Yes, tested on bingsuns.binghamton.edu and localhost using port 7347

How to run:
1. make
2. java TelnetServ <port#>
3. java Telnetcli <serv_domain> <port#>

Special notes:
Absolute paths are assumed to begin with a "/", as shown by the example 
in the assignment documentation (E.g. cd /home/path).
Relative paths have no "/" in the beginning (E.g. cd path).
